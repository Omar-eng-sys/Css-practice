# 📖 Surah Al-Kahf Project

A simple and visually appealing web page design featuring a verse from Surah Al-Kahf — built using HTML and CSS only.

## ✨ Project Idea

The goal of this project is to apply what I’ve learned in the **Intermediate CSS** section of Dr. Angela Yu’s Web Development Bootcamp, combining it with my graphic design background to create a clean and expressive interface.

## 💡 Features

- Custom Arabic fonts
- Soft white glow effect behind the image
- Typography that enhances the spiritual tone
- Mobile-friendly structure *(further responsive tweaks to come)*

## 🚀 Future Improvements
